# Climate Porject - Evolution of Temperature in Algiers: Climate Trend Analysis

### Objective

Analyze decades of temperature records in Algiers to detect central climate tendencies, seasonal variations, and significant long-term trends linked to climate change. Emphasize the connection between temperature dynamics and local socio-economic impacts, supporting decision-making for urban sustainability.

### Data Description
Used over 27 years of daily meteorological data (average, minimum, and maximum values), sourced from trusted climate repositories and validated for consistency.

### Tools

- Excel - Data Cleaning
- Python - Data analysis and modeling

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:

1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.
4. Generating dummy variables.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring climate (temperature) data to answer key questions, such as:

- What is the main trend in temperature over time in Algiers?
- Are there distinct seasonal patterns or cycles in the climate data?
- Do we observe any anomalies, outliers, or notable shifts in temperature across decades?


### Methods & Approach

1. Applied statistical trend modeling (linear regression, seasonal fixed effects), detecting both long-term warming and monthly cycles.
2. Used tests for autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity (Newey-West correction) to ensure robustness.
3. Presented descriptive statistics, time-series analysis, and visualizations (density plots, monthly trends).


### Key Findings

- Demonstrated a statistically significant upward trend in average temperature, consistent with global warming.
- Identified marked seasonal cycles, with clear bimodal distribution separating hot summers and cool winters.
- Quantified the average warming rate and its economic/environmental consequences for the city, referencing global IPCC and World Bank reports for context.

### Impact & Business Value

Findings highlight urgent risks for local infrastructure, public health, and resource management. Results inform policy adaptation, urban planning, and climate resilience strategies.
